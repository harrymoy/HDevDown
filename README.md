# HDevDown

HDevDown is a .txt parser currently in beta made in Python to run through the terminal that converts plain text documents into html.

### Headers

To add header tags add the hash symbol followed by the number you want for the header. For example: #1 is equal to a h1 tag and #2 is equal to a h2 tag.

### Other HTML Elements

More HTML elements will be added in future versions of the script.
